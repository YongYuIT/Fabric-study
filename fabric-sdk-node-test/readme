1. network ref to:

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html

2. if get error when run "npm install", try

npm install --save @google-cloud/vision

or may cause by node version, maybe need to change to older version

3. before launch fabric network by startFabric.sh, add volumes clean

docker volume rm $(docker volume list)
